# Datasets and collections

This document provides descriptions of datasets and collections that are or could be used for experiments in pattern extration, mining or analysis. We focus here on symbolic music datasets, i.e. datasets that correspond to collection of tunes, scores or songs that are represented as events (notes, chords, etc.) and features, rather than through an audio representation of their performance. For each dataset, a short description is provided according to the template below, including the tradition represented by the collection as well as reference of other works having used the collection and to experiments that rely on it.
