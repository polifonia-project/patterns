This document lists work related to pattern extraction, pattern mining and pattern analysis in music data. It is separated in three subtopic: Music representation for pattern analysis in music data, pattern mining techniques for music data, and pattern assessement metrics for music data. Naturally, some works will fall into multiple categories.
