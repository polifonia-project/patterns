This repository aims to collect resources and experiment in the Polifonia project in relation to pattern extraction, pattern mining and pattern analysis. It includes currently three main parts as subfolders of this repository: related-work that includes resources related to various aspect of the pattern work in the project, datasets, which includes information about existing data collections that are used as a basis of the pattern work, and experiments.

## What are experiments in this context

The idea here is that we will explore the different possibilities related to music representation, pattern mining techniques and pattern assessement metrics by experimenting, in subteams, through collections of music data that, ideally, represent specific music traditions for which there is expertise in the project. Experiments here therefore are tests, scripts, techniques, results, etc. that are applied to such collections and that might eventually lead to results applicable to other repositories.

## What about the "Ontology" folder

One output of the work on patterns in Polifonia is a contribution to describing music ontologically through patterns. We therefore expect part results of experiments and of our exploration of related to work to translate into an ontological description of musical patterns, their different types, their relations and the methods used to find and analyse them.
